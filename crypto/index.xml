      <description>This is my first ctf writeup. How exciting! This problem is a warmup crypto question on Vigenere cipher.
Problem Et tu Mr. Mayor?! Mr mayor is eating his salad and he has a good &amp;lsquo;Vigenerete&amp;rsquo; dressing. He is also trying to read his email, but something is wrong with the first line of this file&amp;hellip; I think it is encoded! Can you decrypt it?
Wrap your result in uiuctf{}
