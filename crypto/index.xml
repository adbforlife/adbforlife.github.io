      <description>This is a sourceless Elliptic Curve Crypto (ECC) challenge. ECC is scaryyyy, but I might as well give it a try.
Problem Tom Nook is testing a new encryption scheme for nookphones, but it seems to be a bit faulty... can you break it?
Hints given during ctf:
 Cosmic rays corrupted the prime with random chance in the first option. There are no faults in the second option.  Solution We were given some service running at nc chal.</description>

      <description>This is my first ctf writeup. How exciting! This problem is a warmup crypto question on Vigenere cipher.
Problem Et tu Mr. Mayor?! Mr mayor is eating his salad and he has a good &amp;lsquo;Vigenerete&amp;rsquo; dressing. He is also trying to read his email, but something is wrong with the first line of this file&amp;hellip; I think it is encoded! Can you decrypt it?
Wrap your result in uiuctf{}
